# ABB Challenge - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the ABB challenge.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Sass
- React Testing Library
- Jest

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sergi-CM/abb-challenge-front.git
   ```
2. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
    cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
4. Run the app
   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```

## Running tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Next to-do steps

- Adjust styles to make each table have different heights based on its content.
- Refactor functions to determine icons and headers colors.

## Important note

As the frontend and backend have not been deployed to third-party hosting services (e.g., Vercel for the frontend or Render for the API), all responses and requests are made from localhost URLs.
